This repository contains embedded c code for a MiniGrid Simulation Game project for the EE318 module. The files containing 'commented' were used in the final submission of the project. The report details the design process, justification for decisions, and explanations, can also be found in this repository. 

It is worth noting that running the game requires an MSP430fr4133 Texas Instruments Microcontroller, an embedded C IDE like Code Composer Studio or IAR, and the relevant driver libraries referenced in the files.
